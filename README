This is a library for evaluating well-formed propositional logic expressions.

If the expression provided is not a well-formed formula, it throws an error with position of possible error.
If the expression is a well-formed formula, it goes ahead to evaluate it.

Evaluation is done in steps and the truth table is printed along with the evaluation at each step.

At the end of the evaluation, information regarding validity and consistency of the expression is displayed.

To run this software, from the terminal, do
